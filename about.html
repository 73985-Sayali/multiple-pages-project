                Making homemade chocolate cupcakes is so much easier than you would expect.
                 You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief
                  overview of what you can expect from this simple recipe:
                Sift the dry ingredients (except the sugar) together. Cream the butter and
                 sugar together. Then add the eggs and vanilla. Alternate adding the dry 
                 ingredients and milk. Beat until well combined. Spoon batter into prepared
                  cupcake cups — only fill the cups ¾ of the way full so they don't overflow
                   in the oven. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
                    Frost as desired.
